PITSTOP REACT/REDUX PROJECT

Pitstop is an application built using a React frontend and Rails backend.  Users can anonymously post markers on locations on a map to signify their upcoming trips.  Other users can then see these trips and contact the initial poster to join them on the ride.  Users can also see individual stops so that they can find a trip by a single pitstop that they might want to take.

Prerequisites: To be safe, you will need the latest version of Ruby, React, and Javascript. The bundler/setup should take care of most of what you need, but to be safe, you'll need to have access to the gems in the bundler.

Installation

Go to the following link to find the code for this project:

git@github.com:Rollo510/Pitstop.git

Open with your choice of text editor. Type "bundle install" in command line to install gems. Make sure you've "cd'd" into backend.  Next, run npm start to open up a local server from the frontend.  To save data, a virtual server can be run using "rails s", though you'll likely need to open it on a new port since npm will be taking localhost:3000

Running the program

See above for installation and running instructions.

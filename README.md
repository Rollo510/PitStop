PITSTOP REACT/REDUX PROJECT

Pitstop is an application built using a React frontend and Rails backend.  Users can anonymously post markers on locations on a map to signify their upcoming trips.  Other users can then see these trips and contact the initial poster to join them on the ride.  Users can also see individual stops so that they can find a trip by a single pitstop that they might want to take.

Prerequisites: To be safe, you will need the latest version of Ruby, React, and Javascript.

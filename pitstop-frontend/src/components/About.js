            <h2> What is Pitstop? </h2>
                <p> Pitstop is a ride-sharing application that allows users to post markers on an interactive map to indicate their upcoming trips.</p>
                <p> Other users can then see which trips are available and contact the original trip poster and hitch a ride with them. </p>
            <h2> This doesn't sound safe...</h2>
                <p> That's because it isn't.  You should not use Pitstop to secure a ride with someone at this time. </p>
                <p> In the future, users will be required to input personal information to ensure that you don't "go missing" on one of your trips.</p>
            <h2> You're missing *feature* </h2>
                <p> This is a very early build of Pitstop, and there are more than a few features missing.  I will be adding more soon.</p>
            <h2> Let me speak to your manager! </h2>
                <p> I am the manager. Feel free to contact me at __________ . </p>
